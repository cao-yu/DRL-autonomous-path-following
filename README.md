# DRL-Autonomous-Path-Following
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for autonomous mobile robot path following in a 100% Python environment. A hybrid controller combines Pure Pursuit for steering with a Soft Actor–Critic (SAC) policy for speed control, enabling the robot to follow predefined paths safely and efficiently in simulation.
